## What is Open Source Software ?

Open Source Software (OSS) is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance. Source code is the part of the software that users dont see while navigating their PC's, it's the code computer programmers can manipulate to change how a piece of software&mdash;a "program" or "application"&mdash;works.

Programmers who have access and the knowledge to a computer program source code can improve that program by adding to it, such as new features or fixing bugs it may have. In simple words the term open source refers to something people can modify and share because its design is publicly accessible. 

## How does Open Source work ?

Open source code is usually stored in a public repository and shared publicly. Anyone can access the repository to use the independently or contribute improvements to the overall project.

OSS usually comes with a distribution license. This license includes terms that define how developers can use, study, modify, and distribute the software. Here are some of the most used licenses.

* [MIT License](https://www.tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license) - permissive license, you can do whatever you want with this license as long as you add a copy of the MIT license and copyright notice to it.
* [GNU General Public License(GPL)](https://www.tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-general-public-license-v2)- copyleft license, this means that any software based on any GLP component must be release as open source
* [Apache License](https://www.tldrlegal.com/license/apache-license-2-0-apache-2-0) - permissive license, allows you to freely use, modify, and distribute any apache licensed product, however while doing so you have to follow the terms of the apache license
*BSD License - permissive license, lets you freely modify and distribute your software's code in the source or binary format as long as you retain a copy of the copyright notice, list of conditions, and the disclaimer
* [Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL)](https://www.tldrlegal.com/license/common-development-and-distribution-license-cddl-1-0-explained) - weak-copyleft license, you are free to reproduce and distrubute any works of any software licensed under the CDDL, however you must not remove or make any changes to any copyright, patent, or trademark notices contained in the software. You must also retain any notices of licensing or any descriptive text that attributes any contributor or the initial developer
* [Eclipse Public License (EPL)](https://www.tldrlegal.com/license/eclipse-public-license-1-0-epl-1-0) - weak-copyleft license, if you modify an EPL component and distribute it in the source code form as part of your program, you must disclose the modified code under the EPL. If you distribute such a program in its modified code form, you must state that the source code can be made avaliable to the recipient upon request, and you must explain how to request the source code

When source code is changed, OSS must include what was altered as well as the methods involved. Depending on the license terms, the software resulting from these modifications may or may not be required to be made avaliable for free. 

These license fall under two different types of licenses; proprietary/permissive or open-source/copy-left.

* Proprietary software licenses:
Proprietary software is a restrictive software license that restricts the user to copy, modify or redistribute in any way. It is the most restrictive license that is out there and generally used for commercial purposes.
* open-source software licenses:
Open Source Software license are those licenses where the owner or the creatr of the software has copyright over his work but chooses to ease down some restrictions on his work with respect to the opening, modifying, or redistributing the software. Based on the degree of restrictiveness there are two main types of open source software licenses.

## Why is OSS important ? 

Open souurce is important for many reasons and is widely adopted by many companies such as Microsoft, Apache, Firefox, Linux, Python, to name a few. One thing to note is the difference between propretary software and open source software. We briefly talked about `proprietary` and `open-source` software, and I would say it quite obvious why people would prefer open-source software to  proprietary software. Given the its definition&mdash;Proprietary software is the copyrighted property of an individual or company that limits its use, distribution, and modification by way of a proprietary license.&mdash; Now people prefer open source software to proprietary software for a number of reasons, including; control, training, security, stability and community. Open source gives people the ability to edit and contribute to many projects avaliable in the web (mostly through GitHub). Through these open source projects people are able to learn and train their skill better given that there is a community for most open source projects out there that can help. Open source is also good for security because many people are working on the same project it is easy for them to catch a bug or anything that might be wrong in the code, these projects are also updated quite often so the security is always kept in check.

Now you can't really say one is better than the other, they each have their own pros and cons. The usage of either a proprietary license or an open-source license is determined by the needs of the company or who ever maybe getting it. Here is a [link](http://oss-watch.ac.uk/apps/licdiff/) of questions asked to determine which license is the one for you.

## What is my intrest in OSS

The concept of open source is fairly new to me but as I've read more about it I have come to be more intrested on the topic and what you can do with it. One of the things that cought my eye when reading about open source was the community culture around each project. Reason being because sometimes starting a project from scratch can be very confusing and intimidating, but there are many people working on the same project you choose and lots of documentation to help you get started. Another thing I liked was that you can leave your own personal mark on projects of intrests, most of them being additions to software you already use which is another really cool aspect about open-source.

## Examples of open-source projects

There are plenty of open source projects out there for you to look into. Ultimately it is up to you and what you like and are intrested in. But I know choosing can be difficult so here are some exaamples to get started with:

* [Python open-source projects](https://www.devglan.com/programming/python-open-source-repository)
* [Tenserflow open-source projects](https://www.devglan.com/ai/tensor-flow-open-source-repository)
* [OpenCV open-source projects](https://www.devglan.com/ai/opencv-open-source-repository)
* [Emoji open-source project](https://github.com/theraot/emoji)
* [Game open-source project](https://github.com/bobeff/open-source-games)
* [General open-source project](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions)

Hopefully this blog post helped you learn something about open source software and sparked an intrest in you to start contributing.

Thanks for reading!
