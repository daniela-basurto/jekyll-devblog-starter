## MoveIt

MoveIt is an open source robotics platform for building commercial manipulation applications. MoveIt combines advanced kinematics, motion planning, and collision checking capabilities to plan and execute optimal mations for any robot manipulator. MoveIt is robot agnostic and has been used by hundreds of large corporations, startups and research labs to develop custom automation solutions, because of its academic roots it brings cutting edge algorithms to reality.

# Why It Intrested Me

This project was the first one to catch my eye as I was searching for open source projects to contribute. I had recently taken a course on ROS&mdash;Robot Operating System&mdash;which was supper intresting to me seeing all the things you can do with ROS. So when I came accross this repository I knew I wanted to contribute to it in anyway that I could.

## Jupyter Hub

JupyterHub brings the power of notebooks to groups of users. It gives users access to computational environments and resources without burdening the users with installation and maintenance tasks. JupyterHub can be used in a collaborative environment by both small (0-100 users) and large teams (more than 100 users) such as a class of students, corporate data science group or scientific research group. It has two main distributions which are developed to serve the needs of each of these teams respectively.

# Why It Intrested Me

Jupyter Notebook is a platfrom I use quite often so I was intrested in contributing to their projects. One of the projects that intrested me was the `nbgrader`, which is and interactive way to recieve, send, and grade homework. Teachers and students can all be a part of it, essentially automating your homeworks and grading. Which is super cool!. As I continued looking I came across Jupyter Hub which essentally a collaboration version of Jupyter Notebook, I though the concept was pretty neat so I started looking around in their repository to see how I could contribute.

## Sympy

SymPy is a Python library for symbolic mathematics. It aims to become a full-featured computer algebra system (CAS) while keeping the code as simple as possible in order to be comprehensible and easily extensible. SymPy is written entirely in Python.

* [Sympy Repository](https://github.com/sympy/sympy)

# Why It Intrested Me

Sympy is a python library that I've used before in little projects i've done on my own&mdash;it basically solves algebraic problems for me from time to time&mdash;. Since I'm familiar with the library I found it logical that I would try to contribute to the repo. and because I've used the library before I would have a better chance of understanding some of the issues to fix.

## Pandas

Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language.

* [Pandas Repository](https://github.com/pandas-dev)

# Why It Intrested Me

Yet another python library... yes I'll admit I'm most confortable with python and since this is my first time contributing to an open source project I founded logical to contribute to repo topics that I've used and have an understanding of. Pandas none the less is a great library for data manipylation and filtration that I really like to use to organize simple list that I create.

## Coalas

Coala is a free and open-source language independent analysis toolkit, written in Python. The primary goal of coala is to make it easier for developers to create rules which a project's code should conform to.

# Why It Intrested Me

This repo cought my attention because of the many beginner issues it had. I felt that this could be a good start for me and its also something that I've never used so I found it can be a good learning topic for me as well.

## OpenCv

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. The library has more than 2500 optimized algorithms, which includes a comprehensive set of both classic and state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning algorithms. These algorithms can be used to detect and recognize faces, identify objects, classify human actions in videos, track camera movements, track moving objects and more.

# Why It Intrested Me

OpenCV is so fun to me and deals with a topic that really intrests me. I've used OpenCV before to make my own object detection programs and I love the process so I really want to be able to contribute to their repository. I've taken a look and seems like this is a project for last because soem of the issues seem to advanced but hopefully by th end I'm ablet to contribute to it.
